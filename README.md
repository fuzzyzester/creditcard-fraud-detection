# üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection ‚Äì End-to-End ML + Power BI Project

This project presents a complete end-to-end fraud detection solution, combining machine learning, FastAPI model deployment, and interactive Power BI dashboards to identify and monitor fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world dataset.

It covers the full cycle‚Äîfrom data preprocessing and modeling to API deployment and business intelligence reporting‚Äîdemonstrating how data science and engineering can work together to create scalable, real-world applications.

With fraudulent transactions making up only 0.17% of the dataset, handling highly imbalanced data was a core challenge‚Äîrequiring careful model selection and evaluation to ensure reliable predictions.

##  About the Dataset

- Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset
- Transactions: 284,807
- Fraud Cases: 492 (~0.17%) ‚Üí Highly imbalanced
### Features:
- V1 to V28: anonymized using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Amount: transaction amount
- Time: seconds elapsed since the first transaction
- Class: target variable (1 = fraud, 0 = non-fraud)

### Why PCA?

PCA anonymizes sensitive information while preserving trends and patterns. This keeps user data secure but still useful for fraud detection. V1 to V28 are transformed features that contain the underlying relationships, even if we don't know their original meanings.

##  Machine Learning Process

 Check the full code here: [creditcard_fraud.ipynb](https://github.com/fuzzyzester/creditcard-fraud-detection/blob/main/creditcard_fraud.ipynb)

###  Preprocessing
- Dropped irrelevant features (`Time`)
- Scaled `Amount` using `StandardScaler`
- Separated `X` (features) and `y` (target: fraud or not)

###  Correlation Heatmap 
- **V14, V12, V10**: Strong negative correlation with fraud ‚Üí likely strong indicators
- **V17, V4, V7**: Mild correlations
- **Time**: Very weak ‚Üí Dropped
- **Amount**: Low correlation ‚Üí Still kept after scaling

### Addressing Class Imbalance
Instead of oversampling or undersampling, I leveraged class_weight='balanced' in our Random Forest model. This allowed the model to give more focus to rare fraud cases without artificially changing the dataset size‚Äîensuring better generalization and avoiding overfitting.

###  Models Trained
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest ‚úÖ (Best)
- XGBoost

###  Best Model: Random Forest
- Precision: **98.6%**
- Recall: **96.9%**
- F1 Score: **97.7%**
- ROC AUC: **0.99**

###  Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
- ROC-AUC Score
- Precision-Recall Curve
- Focus on minimizing **False Negatives** (fraud marked as safe)

##  Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard translates machine learning outputs into actionable business intelligence. It provides a comprehensive view of credit card fraud detection performance, risk classification, and transaction-level insights for analysts and decision-makers. The Power BI dashboard uses the output from the prediction phase, which is a subset of the full dataset of 284,807 transactions.

### Dashboard Highlights

üîπ Key KPIs
- Total Transactions Checked: Total records analyzed (e.g., 56,962)
- Flagged as Potential Fraud: Count of transactions predicted as fraud (e.g., 95)
- Overall Fraud Detection Score: Average confidence level across predictions (e.g., 0.85)
- Prediction Accuracy: Model‚Äôs performance on test data (e.g., 100%)
- Frauds Successfully Detected (%): Ratio of correctly identified frauds (e.g., 84%)
- Correct Fraud Alerts (%): Precision of fraud alerts (e.g., 86%)

üîπ Transaction Table (Interactive)
- Displays actual vs. predicted label
- Confidence levels and scaled fraud probability
- Risk Level tags for readability (e.g., Very Low Risk, Low Risk)

üîπ Visual Insights
- Pie Chart: Visual breakdown of predicted fraud vs. legitimate transactions (clearly showing imbalance)
- Stacked Bar Chart: Fraud risk distribution across probability ranges ‚Äì gives an overview of model sensitivity
Slicer Control:
- Adjust probability thresholds
- Filter transactions by risk bracket or model confidence

### KPI Cards and Dynamic Measures

‚úÖ Dynamic DAX Measures have been implemented using CALCULATE, SELECTEDVALUE, and context-aware filtering.

All KPIs respond to slicer filters for accurate analysis.
