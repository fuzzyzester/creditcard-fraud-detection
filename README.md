# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection â€“ End-to-End ML + Power BI Project

This project presents a complete end-to-end fraud detection solution, combining machine learning, FastAPI model deployment, and interactive Power BI dashboards to identify and monitor fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world dataset.

It demonstrates how data science and engineering can work together to create scalable, real-world applications â€” from preprocessing and modeling to deployment and business intelligence.

## About the Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Total Transactions: 284,807
- Fraudulent Transactions: 492 (0.17%) â€“ Highly imbalanced dataset

![Feature Importance](https://github.com/fuzzyzester/creditcard-fraud-detection/blob/main/FeatureImportance.png)

- V1 to V28: Anonymized using PCA
- Amount: Transaction value
- Time: Seconds since the first transaction
- Class: Target variable (1 = Fraud, 0 = Legitimate)

### Why PCA?

PCA anonymizes sensitive information while preserving useful patterns, enabling effective fraud detection without compromising privacy.

---

## Machine Learning Workflow

### Preprocessing

- Dropped low-impact feature: `Time`
- Scaled `Amount` using `StandardScaler`
- Separated `X` (features) and `y` (target)

### Correlation Analysis

- Strong correlations: `V14`, `V12`, `V10`
- Moderate: `V17`, `V4`, `V7`
- Weak: `Time`, `Amount`

### Handling Imbalance

Used `class_weight='balanced'` with Random Forest to emphasize rare fraud cases without oversampling.

### Models Trained

- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost
- Random Forest (Best Performer)

**Best Model Metrics:**

- Precision: 98.6%
- Recall: 96.9%
- F1 Score: 97.7%
- ROC AUC: 0.99

### Evaluation Tools

## Deployment

- Exported final model as `.pkl`: `fraud_model_final.pkl`
- Created prediction CSV: `fraud_predictions.csv`
- Developed a FastAPI backend for local predictions and API access

## Project Learnings

### ML Takeaways

- Class Imbalance Matters: Focused on fraud despite rarity
- Beyond Accuracy: Prioritized recall and precision
- PCA Still Works: Anonymized data can retain predictive power
- Deploy Early: Model deployment adds practical value

### BI Takeaways

- Low % â‰  Low Risk: Fraud impact is high even with low occurrence
- Visual Communication: Key to stakeholder trust and decisions
- BI + ML = Trust: Combining both bridges gaps in technical understanding

---

## Future Improvements

- Live connect Power BI to FastAPI for real-time predictions
- Stream new transactions for continuous fraud detection
- Integrate case management for flagged transactions
